"""Facets — the multi-axis classification layer (option B).

One claim has several *independent* coordinates, and cramming them into the single
epistemic ``regime`` column conflated dimensions that want to move separately.  A facet
is ``(target_kind, target_id, axis, value)`` in a small side table — add an axis by
inserting rows, never a migration.  The axes:

  * ``epistemic``  — fact / convention / fiction / opinion / historical.  This mirrors the
    existing ``regime`` column and is the ONLY axis that gates the corroboration firewall.
  * ``time_frame`` — current / historical / superseded / timeless.  (This is the retrieval
    contract's "temporal regime", renamed so it never collides with epistemic ``regime``.)
  * ``trust_tier`` — high / medium / low.  A reliability rating, even for historical works.
  * ``domain``     — coarse subject bucket (engineering, cooking, …).  Swappable vocabulary;
    can grow toward Dewey later without touching this code.

**Safety invariant:** facets other than ``epistemic`` are *additive read-filters only*.
The firewall (which claim may corroborate which) is unchanged and still keyed on the
epistemic regime.  So populating/filtering facets can never alter what corroborates what.

Derivation is cheap because three of the four axes are *already implied by data we store*
(support trust_weights, pub dates, supersession, source bundle) — this module just reads
those out.  Everything here is pure (takes already-fetched rows) so it unit-tests without
a live KB; ``kb.facetize`` feeds it.
