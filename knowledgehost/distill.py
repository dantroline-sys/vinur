"""Offline distillation — the heart (spec §7, §9.1).  Turns raw source prose into
the *meaning* layer: the big reasoning LM reads each chunk and extracts canonical
**declarative concepts** (the "what" substrate), which are reconciled into the
structured KB as nodes + provenance + retrieval surface.

This is the step the system was missing: we store what a passage *means* (a
self-contained vignette per concept), not a paraphrase of its sentences.

Scope now: the declarative (concepts), **causal/relational** (typed edges with
`mechanism` + `discriminators`), and **procedure** (how-to cards, incl. red_flags /
escalation / discriminators) extractors, with banding reconciliation (§9.1 — within-batch
dedup, then node-identity dedup via link_to_node, §9.4).  The full 5-way reasoned
reconciliation (§9.2) and epistemic-regime adjudication (§8) remain the next milestone.

Stdlib-only transport (urllib), mirroring the Embedder's graceful degradation: if
the LM endpoint is down the run aborts cleanly (nothing marked distilled, so it
resumes), rather than poisoning the KB with empties.

    "the passage states them: `red_flags` (danger signs that mean stop / something is "

    "'would change to'), and `discriminators` ({feature, value} pairs marking WHEN this "
    "procedure applies versus a sibling — the same field and vocabulary as a relation's "
    "discriminators, so a query's context can be matched to the right procedure). Omit "

    "`grade` {strength: strong|conditional, evidence_quality: high|moderate|low, "
    "population} so a graded endorsement is not mistaken for a bare tip.\n"
    "- criteria: for any passage that says how to RECOGNISE, DIAGNOSE, DEFINE, or CLASSIFY "
    "something by its features (a condition, a syndrome, a category, a stage) — the bulk "

    "[{condition, discriminator}] — look-alikes and the feature that tells them apart. "

    "- `discriminators`: how THIS cause's presentation differs from OTHER causes of the "
    "same effect — the field a differential is ranked on. Each is a {feature, value} "
    "pair; REUSE these feature names where they fit: " + _vocab_line() + ". When the "
    "passage contrasts several causes of one effect, those contrasts ARE the "
    "discriminators.\n"

    "{effect_size, direction: increase|decrease|no_effect, study_design: "
    "meta_analysis|rct|cohort|case_control|case_series|expert_opinion|guideline, "
    "population, n, certainty: high|moderate|low} — so the weight of evidence behind the "
    "claim is structured, not lost in prose.\n"
    "BUILD REUSABLE STRUCTURE, not isolated facts:\n"
    "- HUBS (one-to-many): up-link each specific to the GENERAL convention or category "
    "it instances — a taxonomic `is_a`/`instance_of` edge to a broad parent concept "
    "(e.g. 'hold a nail near its head' instance_of 'tool-handling safety'). Emit that "
    "general parent as its own concept so many specifics can share it. Prefer reusing "
    "a broad existing name over inventing a narrow one-off.\n"
    "- DENSITY: a concept usually has SEVERAL relations (what it requires, causes, is "
    "part of, contrasts with), not one. Connect new concepts to each other, not just "
    "to their parent.\n"

# ── typed cards from research-drop hints (brains) ───────────────────────────────
# A solved drop may declare the SHAPE its answer wants to be (front-matter
# card_type + context_features, carried on the chunk via doc_meta).  Four shapes
# extend the procedure/criteria roster along the act they serve — gate → choose →
# continue → learn:
#   requirements — what must be true for a target status ("done", "valid", "ready")
#   decision     — a fork: options, what favors each, tradeoffs, a default
#   playbook     — a recognized state/strategy and the reasonable next moves
#   case         — a worked example: situation, action, outcome, lesson
# The hint is a nudge, never authority: extraction is grounded ONLY in the drop's
# text (empty title = the text doesn't support the shape), payloads are bounded and
# sanitised, and the card lands in the low-trust vinkona bundle like everything
# else from drops.  The drop's own context_features are merged into the card's
# discriminators so the fit-gate retrieves it in the RIGHT situation.
