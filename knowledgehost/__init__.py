"""Vinur — a standalone local general-knowledge tool host.

A large, local, searchable knowledge base a client can query mid-conversation: a
Wikipedia snapshot plus the user's own PDFs, books, journals and miscellany,
returning *cited* passages.  It speaks the Vinkona tool-host contract
(`GET /tools` + `POST /call`, see MAC_TOOLS.md in the Vinkona repo) so it is just
another host in Vinkona's `MultiHost` — point `tools.knowledge.url` at it and the
fast LM can call `kb_search` like any other tool.

Two halves with very different shapes (see KNOWLEDGE.md in the Vinkona repo):
- an **offline ingestion pipeline** (`ingest`)  — heavy, batch, run on demand;
- a **query service** (`server`)               — light, fast, always up.

It is a **separate store from Vinkona's `memories`**: bulk, low-trust, reference-
only, with its own ANN/FTS index.  Returns data, never instructions; every
passage is sanitized + cited before any LM reads it.
