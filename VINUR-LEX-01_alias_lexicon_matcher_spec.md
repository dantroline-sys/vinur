# VINUR-LEX-01 — Alias Lexicon & Deterministic Span Matcher

**Status:** Draft for implementation · **Doc version:** 1.0 · **Date:** 2026-07-05
**Components:** `vinur-lex compile` (write time) · `vinur-lex match` (runtime)
**Implementation language:** Python ≥ 3.12. The runtime component MUST have no ML, GPU, or network dependencies.

RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY) are normative.

---

## 1. Scope and non-goals

This document specifies Stage 0 (lexicon) and Stage 1 (span detection) of the deterministic utterance→graph matching pipeline: the alias table schema, the normalization and tokenization algorithms, the compiled artifacts, the runtime matcher's exact behavior, its I/O contract, and acceptance tests.

Consumers of the output: Stage 2 (sense resolution) consumes `spans[].candidates`; the gap/failure logger consumes `unmatched_token_indices` and `flags`.

**Out of scope** (separate specs):

- Sense resolution. The matcher emits **unresolved candidate sets**; it MUST NOT choose between nodes sharing a surface form.
- Assertion tagging (NegEx/ConText), frame classification, graph expansion, ranking, selection.
- Numeric/dose/unit extraction. Tokens such as `3.5kg` pass through as opaque tokens.
- Alias generation/curation pipeline (including inflection generation). The compiler **validates** alias rows; it does not create them. Generated inflection rows arrive in the table like any other row, with `derived_from` set.
- Real-word spelling errors (a valid vocabulary token typed in place of another). Correction applies to out-of-vocabulary tokens only in v1.

## 2. Definitions

- **Code point offset** — index into the sequence of Unicode code points of the original input string. All character offsets in this document are code point offsets: never bytes, never UTF-16 units.
- **Token** — output of TOK-1 (§4). **Norm token** — output of NORM-1 (§3) applied to a token.
- **Norm sequence** (`norm_seq`) — norm tokens joined by U+001F (UNIT SEPARATOR).
- **OOV** — a norm token absent from the compiled vocabulary.
- **Span** — half-open token-index interval `[tok_start, tok_end)`.
- **Candidate** — an alias row attached to a span.
- **Covered token** — a token whose index lies within a span.

## 3. NORM-1 — token normalization (normative)

Input: the original code points of one token. Steps, applied in this order:

1. Unicode NFKC normalization.
2. Unicode full case folding (C + F mappings).
3. If the result ends with (U+0027 APOSTROPHE or U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) followed by `s`: delete those final two code points.
4. Delete every remaining U+0027 and U+2019.

The output MAY be empty (e.g. input `'s`). Empty-norm tokens are retained in the token list with `norm: ""` but MUST NOT participate in matching, correction, or `unmatched_token_indices`.

NORM-1 MUST be applied identically to alias surfaces (per surface token) at compile time and to utterance tokens at runtime. Any semantic change to NORM-1 is a new `norm_version` and REQUIRES full recompilation (§6.6).

## 4. TOK-1 — tokenization (normative)

TOK-1 operates on the **original** string, before any normalization, so recorded offsets are exact.

`WORD(i)` is true iff the code point `c` at offset `i` satisfies any of:

- (a) Unicode general category of `c` ∈ {Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Nd, Nl, No};
- (b) `c` ∈ {U+0027, U+2019};
- (c) `c` ∈ {U+002E FULL STOP, U+002C COMMA} AND offsets `i−1` and `i+1` both exist AND both have general category Nd.

A **token** is a maximal run of offsets where `WORD` is true. Every other code point is a separator. Hyphen (U+002D), all dashes, and slash are separators **by design**: `post-op` ≡ `post op` ≡ `post/op` after tokenization, giving hyphenation-insensitive matching with no special cases.

Each token records `[char_start, char_end)` in original code point offsets. Tokens are numbered `0..n−1` left to right.

Normative consequences:

- `Cold-work` → tokens `Cold`, `work`
- `0.5` → one token `0.5`; `1,000` → one token `1,000`; `.5` → token `5` (leading `.` has no digit on its left)
- `H2O/CO2` → tokens `H2O`, `CO2`
- `Brinell's` → one token (apostrophe is a word character; NORM-1 later strips it)

## 5. Data model

### 5.1 DDL (SQLite ≥ 3.45; lives in, or is attached alongside, the knowledge-graph database)

```sql
CREATE TABLE alias (
  alias_id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  node_id       TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- global graph ID incl. authority prefix, e.g. 'pub:defect.fracture'
  surface       TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- curated form, exactly as entered
  norm_seq      TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- TOK-1 + NORM-1 of surface, tokens joined by U+001F (derived; verified at compile, §6.3 C4)
  n_tokens      INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (n_tokens BETWEEN 1 AND 8),
  alias_type    TEXT    NOT NULL CHECK (alias_type IN
                  ('preferred','synonym','index_term','variant','abbrev','informal','inflection')),
  weight        REAL    NOT NULL CHECK (weight > 0.0 AND weight <= 1.0),
  case_mode     TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'fold' CHECK (case_mode IN ('fold','exact','caps')),
  fuzzy_allowed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (fuzzy_allowed IN (0, 1)),
  origin        TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- 'pub' | 'addon:<addon_id>' | 'user'
  derived_from  INTEGER REFERENCES alias(alias_id),  -- set for generated inflections, else NULL
  status        TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active','retired')),
  UNIQUE (node_id, norm_seq)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_alias_norm ON alias (norm_seq) WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 5.2 Field semantics

**weight** — set at curation time and stored explicitly; the compiler never infers it. Curation defaults: preferred 1.00, synonym 0.90, index_term 0.85, variant 0.85, abbrev 0.80, informal 0.70, inflection = 0.95 × weight of its `derived_from` row.

**case_mode** — evaluated per covered token against the ORIGINAL utterance text (multi-token aliases: every token must pass):

- `fold` — NORM-1 equality suffices; no further constraint.
- `exact` — NFKC(original utterance token) must equal NFKC(alias surface token) code point for code point, i.e. before case folding.
- `caps` — every cased letter (category Lu/Ll/Lt) in the covered utterance token(s) must be Lu.

**fuzzy_allowed = 0** — declares the alias safety-critical for spelling (look-alike / sound-alike identifiers, e.g. alloy designations like `inconel` vs `incoloy`). Effects defined in §6.4 (vocabulary classes) and §7 stages M3/M4. Spelling correction MUST NEVER create a match for such an alias.

Cross-node duplicates of `norm_seq` are legal — that is surface ambiguity, and it surfaces as multiple candidates on one span. Same-node duplicates are illegal (UNIQUE constraint).

### 5.3 Curation constraints (enforced by the compiler, §6.3)

- **C1** — single-token alias with norm length ≤ 2 code points → `case_mode` ∈ {exact, caps} AND `fuzzy_allowed` = 0.
- **C2** — single-token alias whose norm ∈ EN_STOP_V1 (Appendix A) → `case_mode` ∈ {exact, caps}.
- **C3** — `node_id` must exist in the graph's node table.
- **C4** — stored `norm_seq` and `n_tokens` must equal recomputation from `surface` via TOK-1 + NORM-1.

## 6. Compiler — `vinur-lex compile` (write time)

### 6.1 Invocation

CLI: `vinur-lex compile --db <kg.sqlite> --out <artifact_dir>`
API: `compile_lexicon(db: Path, out: Path) -> CompileReport`

### 6.2 Input

All `alias` rows with `status = 'active'`.

### 6.3 Validation

Run ALL checks, collect ALL findings, then fail (no artifacts written except the report) if any ERROR exists.

ERROR: violations of C1–C4; any empty norm token inside a `norm_seq`.
WARN: one `norm_seq` mapping to more than 4 distinct `node_id`s; an alias with `origin` `user` or `addon:*` sharing a `norm_seq` with a `pub` alias of a **different** node.

Report: `<out>/compile_report.json` — `{"findings":[{"level","code","alias_id","message"}], "counts":{...}}`.

### 6.4 Artifacts

All artifacts are read-only after build. Binary formats are implementation-defined EXCEPT `lexicon.meta.json`.

1. **Vocabulary** — map: norm token → dense `uint32 tok_id`. Tokens sorted by UTF-8 byte order; ids assigned in that order. Per-token metadata:
   - `freq` — count of active alias rows containing the token at any position.
   - `fuzzy_class` ∈ {`targetable`, `suppressed`, `none`}:
     - `targetable` — appears in ≥ 1 active alias with `fuzzy_allowed=1`, AND norm length ≥ 4, AND contains ≥ 1 category-L code point.
     - `suppressed` — not targetable, AND appears in ≥ 1 active alias with `fuzzy_allowed=0`, AND norm length ≥ 4, AND contains ≥ 1 category-L code point.
     - `none` — otherwise.
2. **Aho–Corasick automaton** over `tok_id` **sequences** of all active aliases; each terminal state stores the `alias_id`s ending there. Matching is token-level; character-level AC MUST NOT be used.
3. **SymSpell deletion index** — max edit distance 2, prefix length 7 — over all vocabulary tokens with `fuzzy_class ≠ none`. Distance metric everywhere in this spec: Damerau–Levenshtein, optimal-string-alignment variant (insert, delete, substitute, adjacent transpose; unit costs).
4. **`lexicon.meta.json`** — `{"lexicon_version","norm_version":"NORM-1","tok_version":"TOK-1","alias_count","vocab_size","built_at"}`.

### 6.5 lexicon_version

Lowercase hex SHA-256 over the canonical dump: active alias rows sorted by `alias_id`, each serialized as a JSON array `[alias_id, node_id, surface, norm_seq, n_tokens, alias_type, weight_as_%.4f_string, case_mode, fuzzy_allowed, origin, derived_from, status]`, rows joined by `\n`, encoded UTF-8.

### 6.6 Version discipline

Any semantic change to NORM-1 or TOK-1 is a new `norm_version`/`tok_version` and REQUIRES recompilation. The matcher MUST refuse artifacts whose version fields differ from its own compiled-in versions (`E_ARTIFACT_MISMATCH`).

## 7. Matcher — `vinur-lex match` (runtime)

### 7.0 Interface

```python
class Matcher:
    @classmethod
    def load(cls, artifact_dir: Path) -> "Matcher":
        """Loads artifacts; validates versions. Instance is immutable and
        thread-safe after load. match() is reentrant."""
    def match(self, text: str) -> dict:        # schema in §8
    def match_json(self, text: str) -> bytes:  # canonical serialization, §8.3
```

CLI: `vinur-lex match --artifacts <dir> --text "<utterance>"` → canonical JSON on stdout.

Stages M0–M6 are normative and run in order.

**M0 — Input validation.** `text` MUST be a `str` containing no lone surrogates (else `E_INVALID_INPUT`). Length > 4096 code points → `E_INPUT_TOO_LONG`. Empty or all-separator input → valid result with empty `tokens`/`spans`/`flags` arrays.

**M1 — Tokenize + normalize.** Apply TOK-1, then NORM-1 to each token. Map each non-empty norm to its `tok_id`; absent → OOV sentinel.

**M2 — Exact pass.** Run the AC automaton over the `tok_id` sequence → raw matches `(span, {alias_id...})`. Within each raw match, remove candidate aliases that fail their `case_mode` test (§5.2) against the original covered tokens. Remove matches left with zero candidates. Survivors are the **exact match set**.

**M3 — Spelling correction.** Correction-candidate tokens: every index `i` such that (a) token `i` is OOV, (b) `i` is not covered by any exact-set span, (c) norm length ≥ 4, (d) norm contains ≥ 1 category-L code point. Maximum distance `d_max`: norm length 4–6 → 1; ≥ 7 → 2.

For each candidate token, in ascending `i`: SymSpell lookup → hits `(vocab_token, distance ≤ d_max)`. If no hits, leave unchanged. Else let `D` = minimum distance among hits and `H` = hits at distance `D`:

- If **any** member of `H` has `fuzzy_class = suppressed` → do NOT correct. Emit flag `{type:"fuzzy_suppressed", stage:"token", token_index:i, nearest:<member of H with fuzzy_class=suppressed, chosen by max freq then lexicographic min>, distance:D}`.
- Otherwise correct token `i` to the member of `H` chosen by max `freq`, then lexicographic min; record `corrected_from` (original norm) and `edit_distance = D`.

**M4 — Fuzzy pass.** If M3 corrected ≥ 1 token: rerun AC over the corrected `tok_id` sequence. The working match set becomes the union over both passes of `(span, candidate)` pairs (dedupe on `(tok_start, tok_end, alias_id)`). Apply `case_mode` filtering exactly as in M2 (always against original text). Then remove every candidate whose alias has `fuzzy_allowed = 0` AND whose span covers ≥ 1 corrected token; if a span thereby loses all candidates, emit flag `{type:"fuzzy_suppressed", stage:"span", token_index:<lowest corrected token index in span>, nearest:<space-joined norm_seq of the removed alias with lowest alias_id>, distance:<sum of edit_distance over covered corrected tokens>}` and drop the span.

**M5 — Overlap resolution.** Merge matches with identical spans (union their candidates). Then repeat until none remain: among remaining matches select by (i) smallest `tok_start`; (ii) largest `tok_end`; (iii) highest top-candidate score (§ M6 formula); (iv) lowest top-candidate `alias_id`. Emit the selection; delete every remaining match whose span intersects it. Report emitted spans sorted by `tok_start`. (Effect: leftmost-longest wins; nested and crossing matches are dropped.)

**M6 — Scoring & assembly.**
`candidate_score = weight × ∏ f(edit_distance of each corrected covered token)`, with `f(1) = 0.8`, `f(2) = 0.6`; the product over an empty set is 1 (exact candidates score = weight). Round half-even to 4 decimal places.
Candidates within a span sort by score descending, then `alias_id` ascending.
Span fields: `fuzzy` = (any covered token was corrected); `matched_norm` = norm tokens joined by U+0020; `char_start`/`char_end` = `char_start` of first covered token / `char_end` of last covered token (internal separators such as hyphens are therefore included in `surface_original`); `surface_original` = original substring `[char_start, char_end)`.
`unmatched_token_indices` = every token index with non-empty norm not covered by any emitted span.

## 8. Output contract

### 8.1 Schema

JSON object; keys MUST appear in exactly this order. All `weight`/`score` values are serialized with exactly 4 decimal places (`%.4f`).

```json
{
  "matcher_version": "1.0.0",
  "lexicon_version": "<64 hex chars>",
  "norm_version": "NORM-1",
  "tok_version": "TOK-1",
  "text": "<original input, unmodified>",
  "tokens": [
    {"i": 0, "surface": "Cold", "norm": "cold",
     "char_start": 0, "char_end": 4,
     "corrected_from": null, "edit_distance": 0}
  ],
  "spans": [
    {"span_id": 0, "tok_start": 0, "tok_end": 3,
     "char_start": 0, "char_end": 15,
     "surface_original": "Cold-work marks",
     "matched_norm": "cold work marks",
     "fuzzy": false,
     "candidates": [
       {"alias_id": 9, "node_id": "pub:defect.cold_work_marks", "alias_type": "informal",
        "weight": 0.7000, "score": 0.7000}
     ]}
  ],
  "unmatched_token_indices": [3],
  "flags": []
}
```

Token notes: `surface` is the original substring; a corrected token has `norm` = the corrected vocabulary token, `corrected_from` = its original norm, `edit_distance` > 0. Uncorrected tokens: `corrected_from: null`, `edit_distance: 0`. `span_id` = ordinal position after M5 sorting, from 0.

Flag object: `{"type":"fuzzy_suppressed","stage":"token"|"span","token_index":int,"nearest":str,"distance":int}`.

### 8.2 Determinism guarantee

For fixed `(text, lexicon_version, matcher_version)`, `match_json()` output MUST be byte-identical across runs, platforms, and thread counts.

### 8.3 Canonical serialization

UTF-8; separators `,` and `:` (no whitespace); keys in §8.1 order; arrays ordered: `tokens` by `i`; `spans` by `tok_start`; `candidates` by (score desc, alias_id asc); `flags` by (`token_index` asc, then stage `token` before `span`); non-ASCII emitted as raw UTF-8 (no `\uXXXX` escaping).

## 9. Errors

Raised as `LexError(code, message)`:

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `E_INVALID_INPUT` | not a `str`, or contains lone surrogates |
| `E_INPUT_TOO_LONG` | > 4096 code points |
| `E_ARTIFACT_MISSING` | artifact dir incomplete/unreadable at `load()` |
| `E_ARTIFACT_MISMATCH` | artifact version fields ≠ matcher's compiled-in versions |

Matching MUST NOT raise for any valid input string.

## 10. Performance requirements

Assumptions: ≤ 5,000,000 active alias rows; vocabulary ≤ 2,000,000 tokens.

- `load()` ≤ 10 s cold; process RSS after load ≤ 4 GiB.
- `match()` p99 ≤ 2 ms for utterances ≤ 128 tokens, single performance core (Apple M4 / Zen 4 class).
- Zero network, GPU, or model inference at runtime. Permitted runtime dependencies: Python stdlib plus at most one compiled extension implementing AC/SymSpell.

## 11. Acceptance tests

An implementation is conformant iff it reproduces every vector below exactly (byte-identical canonical JSON), with `lexicon_version` compared against `^[0-9a-f]{64}$` rather than by value.

### 11.1 Test lexicon (all `status=active`, `origin=pub`, `derived_from=NULL`)

| alias_id | node_id | surface | alias_type | weight | case_mode | fuzzy_allowed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | pub:proc.galvanising | galvanising | preferred | 1.00 | fold | 1 |
| 2 | pub:proc.galvanising | galvanizing | variant | 0.85 | fold | 1 |
| 3 | pub:defect.brittle_fracture | brittle fracture | preferred | 1.00 | fold | 1 |
| 4 | pub:defect.fracture | fracture | preferred | 1.00 | fold | 1 |
| 5 | pub:mat.polyethylene | PE | abbrev | 0.80 | caps | 0 |
| 6 | pub:phys.potential_energy | PE | abbrev | 0.80 | caps | 0 |
| 7 | pub:alloy.inconel | inconel | preferred | 1.00 | fold | 0 |
| 8 | pub:test.brinell_hardness | Brinell hardness | preferred | 1.00 | fold | 1 |
| 9 | pub:defect.cold_work_marks | cold work marks | informal | 0.70 | fold | 1 |

### 11.2 Vectors

**V1** — `text = "Cold-work marks after galvanising."` Full expected value:

```json
{"matcher_version":"1.0.0","lexicon_version":"<hex64>","norm_version":"NORM-1","tok_version":"TOK-1",
 "text":"Cold-work marks after galvanising.",
 "tokens":[
  {"i":0,"surface":"Cold","norm":"cold","char_start":0,"char_end":4,"corrected_from":null,"edit_distance":0},
  {"i":1,"surface":"work","norm":"work","char_start":5,"char_end":9,"corrected_from":null,"edit_distance":0},
  {"i":2,"surface":"marks","norm":"marks","char_start":10,"char_end":15,"corrected_from":null,"edit_distance":0},
  {"i":3,"surface":"after","norm":"after","char_start":16,"char_end":21,"corrected_from":null,"edit_distance":0},
  {"i":4,"surface":"galvanising","norm":"galvanising","char_start":22,"char_end":33,"corrected_from":null,"edit_distance":0}],
 "spans":[
  {"span_id":0,"tok_start":0,"tok_end":3,"char_start":0,"char_end":15,"surface_original":"Cold-work marks",
   "matched_norm":"cold work marks","fuzzy":false,
   "candidates":[{"alias_id":9,"node_id":"pub:defect.cold_work_marks","alias_type":"informal","weight":0.7000,"score":0.7000}]},
  {"span_id":1,"tok_start":4,"tok_end":5,"char_start":22,"char_end":33,"surface_original":"galvanising",
   "matched_norm":"galvanising","fuzzy":false,
   "candidates":[{"alias_id":1,"node_id":"pub:proc.galvanising","alias_type":"preferred","weight":1.0000,"score":1.0000}]}],
 "unmatched_token_indices":[3],
 "flags":[]}
```

(Pretty-printed here for readability; conformance is against the §8.3 canonical form.)

**V2** — `"Query PE."` → 1 span at tok `[1,2)`, `fuzzy:false`, candidates `[alias 5 (score 0.8000), alias 6 (score 0.8000)]` — equal scores, tie broken by `alias_id` asc. `unmatched_token_indices:[0]`.

**V3** — `"made of pe"` → 0 spans (`caps` fails for lowercase `pe`); `unmatched_token_indices:[0,1,2]`; no flags. Case-mode failure is not a flagged event.

**V4** — `"hot galvenising"` → token 1 is OOV, length 11, `d_max=2`; unique minimum-distance hit `galvanising` (d=1, targetable) → corrected. 1 span tok `[1,2)`, `fuzzy:true`, candidate alias 1 with `score:0.8000` (1.00 × f(1)). Token 1: `"norm":"galvanising","corrected_from":"galvenising","edit_distance":1`. `unmatched_token_indices:[0]`.

**V5** — `"cast inconl"` → token 1 OOV; nearest hit `inconel` (d=1) has `fuzzy_class=suppressed` → NO correction, no span. Flag: `{"type":"fuzzy_suppressed","stage":"token","token_index":1,"nearest":"inconel","distance":1}`. `unmatched_token_indices:[0,1]`.

**V6** — `"brittle fracture observed"` → exact matches: alias 3 at `[0,2)`, alias 4 at `[1,2)`. M5 selects alias 3 (smaller tok_start, larger tok_end); alias 4's match intersects and is deleted. 1 span; `unmatched_token_indices:[2]`.

**V7** — `"Brinell's hardness"` → tokens `Brinell's`(norm `brinell`), `hardness`. 1 span tok `[0,2)`, `matched_norm:"brinell hardness"`, candidate alias 8, `score:1.0000`.

**V8** — `""` → `tokens:[]`, `spans:[]`, `unmatched_token_indices:[]`, `flags:[]`; no error.
